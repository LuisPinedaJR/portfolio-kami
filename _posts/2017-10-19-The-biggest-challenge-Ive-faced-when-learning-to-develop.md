The biggest challenge I’ve faced learning to develop would have to be learning to read, write and understand JavaScript code. I’ve had experience with building sites before but It was very basic HTML/ CSS. I’ve had enough practice to understand HTML and CSS at the start of the Bloc program but when it came to understanding and using JavaScript, it was foreign. It was really hard to read and understand what was going on at first.

I didn't give up. I watched videos and practiced JavaScript to develop muscle memory and overtime I realized that I could read and put functions together with eaze. I had the help of my mentor at Bloc.io and he provided material to help me build my skill up. I have become confident in understanding key principles and I know with more practice I’ll become a talented developer.
