I have tried boot camp style programs but they have failed to keep my focus and challenge me and other programs donâ€™t have a mentor; to show you and talk you through problems.
I decided to join Bloc.io because it allowed me to meet expert individuals and choose one to  mentor me.
So far, my experience with Bloc has been fun and challenging which does not compare to boot camp style programs.
Bloc.io forces you to put in work, find and research principles to be able to complete each checkpoint.
Bloc.io has introduced me to new topics and a new way of thinking about problems, how to manage and work through them.
The mentor talks goes over the assignments and also shows you how experts in the field would have solved it; that allows you to get perspective from experts which is great!
