I have tried other boot camp style programs but they have failed to keep my focus and challenge me and the other programs don’t have a mentor to show you and talk you through problems. I decided to join Bloc because it had many good reviews and also included a mentor to speak with once a week. So far my experience with Bloc has been fun and challenging which is something I didn’t did with other bootcamp style programs. Bloc forces you to put in work and find and research topics to be able to complete each checkpoint. Bloc has introduced me to new topics and a new way of thinking about how to get things done little by little and breaking things down to manageable tasks. One thing that really is nice to have within Bloc is the mentor. The mentor talks you through checkpoints, pushes you and provides professional advice. I like how the program is built to change up your mentor so you don’t to comfortable with one mentor and get experience with other professionals in the business; that allows you to get perspective from others which is great! After completing each project Bloc asks to choose a new mentor.
